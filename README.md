# Competitive-Micromouse-2019
Codes for a highly tuned line follower that uses optimized PID to ensure quick and precise line following.

This code powered sevral mice that we used at Team Robotics Skncoe, to participate in and win competitive line following events. The line follower was a sophisticatedly desined, balanced bot that used 6-array high quality sensors detect and follow lines, curves and complicated patterns. This code is custom tuned for a specific bot, whose weight and motor torque is considered to calibrate the KP and KD values in the PID algorithm. When finely tuned, the bot would clear a 5 meter course in a matter of seconds.
